Movie Recommendation System

Project Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a simple yet powerful application designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. Utilizing the famous MovieLens dataset, the system compares movies and recommends those that are most similar to a movie selected by the user. This project demonstrates the implementation of collaborative filtering techniques to create personalized movie recommendations.

Dataset
We leverage the MovieLens dataset, a widely-used dataset in the field of movie recommendation systems. The dataset contains:

User Ratings: Information on user ratings of various movies.
Movie Metadata: Details like movie titles, genres, and other attributes.
The dataset is ideal for building and testing recommendation algorithms due to its richness and diversity.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.
NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data cleaning, transformation, and handling of tabular data.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
Scikit-learn: To implement the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm used in the recommendation engine.
Visual Studio Code: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding and debugging.

Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies

Usage
Data Exploration: Start with exploratory_analysis.ipynb to understand the dataset and visualize patterns in the data.
Model Building: Use model_building.ipynb to build, train, and evaluate the KNN-based recommendation model.
Main Script: Run main.py to process the data and generate movie recommendations.

Results
The recommendation system effectively suggests movies that are similar to the selected movie based on user ratings and movie metadata. The KNN algorithm performs well, showcasing the potential of collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
