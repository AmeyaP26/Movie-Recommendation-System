Movie Recommendation System Project
Project Overview:
This project involves building a simple movie recommendation system using the famous MovieLens dataset. The system recommends movies to users based on their similarity to a selected movie.

Dataset:
We use the MovieLens dataset, a popular dataset for movie recommendation systems that includes user ratings, movie metadata, and more.

Folder Structure:


This repo contains Python notebook (main.py) for model building and data processing.
data: Dataset used for training and testing our recommendation model.

Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language 
NumPy and Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploration.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm used in the recommendation model.
Visual Studio Code - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for coding.
